                    <p>Something that has resulted from my surprising success is the amount of subscribers I have gained over the years. With just 25 videos on my channel, not all of them even being music uploads, I currently have over 110K subscribers. That is over one hundred thousand people who looked at my content and decided that they had faith in me and wanted to see more! When I think about it, it really makes me emotional.</p>
