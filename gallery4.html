                    <p>This is a photo of my cat, Mo. She is just over a year old and is as spastic as she is cute. In my life, things can become incredibly stressful. School, my music career, my friends, my family especially... Sometimes it can REALLY be difficult to push onwards and put one foot in front of the other. But my sweet Mo is one of the reasons I can smile after a long tiring day. Because of how important she is to me, I thought I should put her here. My number one supporter. :]</p>
