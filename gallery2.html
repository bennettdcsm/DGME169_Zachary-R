                    <p>Something that I find quite surprising even to this day is the amount of success I have had in uploading my music to Youtube. Pictured above is "Heaven Says (Mandela Mix)", my most viewed video with over 17 million views. Once upon a time, I had under 100 subscribers and only uploaded recordings of my piano performances at talent shows to my channel. But now I have uploaded multiple songs and remixes that have amassed millions of views!! Sometimes it can feel overwhelming and it puts pressure on me, but I try to think of it as a positive.</p>
