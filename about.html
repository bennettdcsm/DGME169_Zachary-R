                    <p>Well, if you insist...</p>
                    <p>My name is Zachary Rohatch, but you can call me Zac. As of December 7th, I am 20 years old; born and raised in the Bay Area. My interests span many nerdy things such as video games, drawing, cartoons, movies, and most important of all: MUSIC! Ever since the fourth grade I have been a fan of playing an instrument. I started on trumpet and then switched to piano, while also learning basic ukelele. In 2021 I was gifted FL Studio and my journey of making music in a professional sense began!</p>

                    <p>I upload my music to my Youtube channel, "<i>Z Sharp Studios</i>". You may also see me on Spotify, Apple Music, and countless other streaming services! For four years now I have been creating what I would consider high-quality content not only in the music itself, but the visual component as well. Over the course of these four years I have been met with success that surprised me, and it might push me into making this my career!</p>
