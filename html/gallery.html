                        <p>Here is an example of one of my FL Studio project files! This is a rather complex one with a lot of different plugins and melodies within it. You can see how much work I have to do to make good music from this image alone!</p>

                        <p>This is my most popular video on my Youtube channel, titled "Heaven Says (Mandela Mix)". It is a remix of a fanmade Deltarune boss fight theme titled "Heaven Says". The original song grew incredibly popular across Youtube and Tiktok, which inspired me to do my own lyrical take on the song themed around an internet horror series "The Mandela Catalogue". It is now the most popular version of said song, harboring its own slew of videos made with it in the background much like the original song had.</p>
