                    <p>My name is Zac, full name Zachary Rohatch. I was born May 28th, 2005 in the Bay Area and have lived here my whole life. My interests span many nerdy things such as video games, drawing, cartoons, movies, and MUSIC! I'll discuss that a little more in a moment. My favorite video games are Deltarune, ULTRAKILL, Friday Night Funkin, Super Mario Galaxy, and VVVVVV. My favorite cartoons are Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Gravity Falls. My favorite movie of all time is Wall-E. All of these games and shows I have watched have shaped my main hobby and career path: Making <mark style="background-color: white;">MUSIC!!</mark></p>
                    <p>Ever since the age of however old you normally are in 4th grade, I have had interest in making my own music. I took up the trumpet in my elementary school band class and kept with that until 8th grade where I began taking interest in the piano. I played a song for both my middle school and high school talent shows a year apart and uploaded those to Youtube under the channel name <i>"Z Sharp Studios"</i>. In December 2021 I was gifted FL Studio, a digital audio workstation, for Christmas. Ever since then, I have been making my own music and remixes and posting them to Youtube to a surprising amount of success.</p>
